Import wait_random from the previous python file that youâ€™ve written and
write an async routine called wait_n that takes in 2 int arguments (in this
order): n and max_delay. You will spawn wait_random n times with the specified
max_delay. wait_n should return the list of all the delays (float values). The
list of the delays should be in ascending order without using sort() because of
concurrency.
